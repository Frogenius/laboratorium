The Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an optical measurement technique used for
investigation of wide range of scattering or semitransparent materials. The OCT enables
surface and subsurface examination of different types of materials to be performed in
non-contact and non-destructive way. With the aid of OCT one can visualize the depth
structure of investigated materials, measure its thickness and also detect some defects and
inhomogeneities with measurement resolution of few Âµm, high sensitivity and dynamic range.
Nowadays, the advantages of OCT make it applied in medical diagnosis especially in
ophthalmology, dermatology, stomatology and endoscopy as well, as in industry and science.
Beyond medical applications the OCT is used for material characterization, surface and
subsurface defect localization, strain fields mapping in polymers, ceramic materials
examination, as well as art conservation. The high an application potential makes the OCT an
interesting tool for scientists and researches from many fields of interests.
