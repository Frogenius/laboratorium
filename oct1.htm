            <h1 class="myH">The OCT principles of operations</h1><br /><br />

The OCT measurements are based on a selective detection of the light backscattered from the
particular scattering points located the investigated object, which is needed for 2D and 3D
tomography imaging. To perform such measurements, low-coherence interferometry (LCI) is
applied. The LCI, also known as white-light interferometry (WLI), is an attractive
measurement method offering high measurement resolution, high sensitivity and
measurement speed. Unlike classic interferometry, where ambiguity of measurement result
often exists, LCI can provide unambiguous (i.e. absolute) measurement result relatively
easily. An example of OCT setup has been shown in Fig. 1.<br />

Low-coherence light emitted by the broadband source is divided into two beams by a beam
splitter and guided into two interferometer arms. One of the beams is focused on the
investigated sample and the other one is guided into a moving reference mirror. The light
reflected back from the sample interferes with the beam reflected by the mirror. The
interference fringes can be detected only if the optical path lengths difference in the
interferometer arms is not bigger than the coherence length of the source. The interference
signal can be seen in the Fig. 1.
